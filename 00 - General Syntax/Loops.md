 ## Loops

A loop allows you to control the flow of your project by descibing repetitive processes. This can be used with a set number of steps or it can be unknown. 

A 'for loop' creates a loop. It continuously goes over a list or array (or any other sequence). 

It uses two key words: 
+ for 
+ in 

```swift

for item in items {
// doSomething
}

```
A blank for loop looks like this ^
