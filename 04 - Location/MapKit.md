 ## MapKit 
 
```swift

import MapKit 

```

MapKit is used to embed a mapView into your project. Importing this framework allows you to use their specific commands a few of which can be found in the project we did, such as: 

+ MKCoordinateSpan
+ MKCoordinateRegion

(MK - MapKit) 

I would recommend having a look at: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit to see the extent of topics available to use within this framework. If you don't import the framework at the top of each file you want to use maps in, any topic you want to use in relation to the mapView will error as 'unrecognised'.
