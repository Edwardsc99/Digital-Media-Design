 ## Images

### Task: 

Use the previous weeks segues and delegates project as a template and instead of sending text from one view to another send an image. 

Tip: 
+ Set up 2 image views in each view controller 
+ Go through and swap out textField for imageView 
+ Remeber it is no longer a String! The type of data has changed to a UIImage
