## 06 - Protocols/Delegates

### Notes

Here you will find support material from the workshop we did that covers: 
+ Protocols/Delegates
+ Segues

### Tips
+ To not use up memory space we use 'dismiss' - this stop pages from layering up and wasting memeory. 
+ Protocols appear above your class
+ Check your spacing, the indentations on the project attached show how it should be. If you get into a good habit of spacing your project correctly it will make it a lot easier to read!  
+ Check for typos and capital letters - remember it all needs to match.
