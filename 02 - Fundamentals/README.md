## 02 - Fundamentals 

### Notes

Here you will find support material from the workshop we did that covers: 
+ Classes
+ Properties
+ Functions

### Tips
+ Remember to check your brackets - they should all have a pair. Remember you can use the double click on any bracket to check where its pair is.
+ Check your spacing, the indentations on the project attached show how it should be. If you get into a good habit of spacing your project correctly it will make it a lot easier to read!  
+ Check for typos and capital letters - remember it all needs to match.

There is also similar documentation for all this in the General Syntax folder:
