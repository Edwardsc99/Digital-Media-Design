####Why GitHub?
+ It gets you used to interacting with GitHub.
+ It makes it easy to correct errors. 
+ Syntax highlighting on code snippets.  
+ Easier for you to copy/paste...even though you would never do that ;).   
+ You can create issues to ask questions and for help. That way everyone can see them and learn together. 

####Questions/Errors
When you navigate to the repo in a browser, along the top navigation you'll see "Issues". I want to encourage you to use this as a way to ask questions and notify me of typos or errors. When you enter the issues page you can create a new issue in the upper right. This is essentially just like posting a comment. One thing that would be helpful is that you apply a relevant label. This is done on the right, eg "Question" or "Bug".

####Sample Files & Projects
Where applicable, I'll post files and projects. However, I'll try to refrain from posting full projects unless I feel it's essential. I'll always lean towards posting "completed" examples of files we were working on in the workshops. These will always be in an "Examples" directory for the relevant workshop. For example the "02 - Delegates/Examples" directory has a finished example of the `Person.swift` file and the `ViewController.swift` file for your reference.
