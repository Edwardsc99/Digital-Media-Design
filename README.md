### Why GitHub?
+ It gets you used to interacting with GitHub.
+ It makes it easy to correct errors. 
+ Syntax highlighting on code snippets.  
+ Easier for you to copy/paste...even though you would never do that ;).   
+ You can create issues to ask questions and for help. That way everyone can see them and learn together. 

### Questions/Errors
When you navigate to the repo in a browser, along the top navigation you'll see "Issues". Use this as a way to ask questions and notify. When you enter the issues page you can create a new issue in the upper right. This is essentially just like posting a comment. One thing that would be helpful is that you apply a relevant label. This is done on the right, eg "Question" or "Bug".
